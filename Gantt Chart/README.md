**3**. Add all the fields to the Deneb visual ensuring hierarchy is not being used for the date fields.

![](https://github.com/PBI-David/Deneb-Showcase/blob/main/Gantt%20Chart/2.png?raw=true)

**4.** Create a new empty Vega specification

![](https://github.com/PBI-David/Deneb-Showcase/blob/main/Gantt%20Chart/3.png?raw=true)

**5.** Paste the specification from the sample .pbix

**6.** Close the Deneb editor and the Gannt will now be fully functional.

The following options can be easily configured within the specification.

## Member Leave adaptation (no phase hierarchy)

A member-focused variant of the chart is provided in `Gantt Member Leave Spec.json`.

### Suggested field mapping from your model

Use these source columns in Deneb values (no hierarchy on dates):

| Required by spec | Suggested model field |
| --- | --- |
| `START_DATE` (or `start`) | `MEMBER_LEAVE_MONITOR[START_DATE]` |
| `END_DATE` (or `end`) | `MEMBER_LEAVE_MONITOR[END_DATE]` |
| `MEM_UID` | `MEMBER_LEAVE_MONITOR[MEM_UID]` or `MCS_MEMBER[MEM_UID]` |
| `Display Name` (or `task`) | `MCS_MEMBER[Display Name]` |
| `phase` (optional) | Optional manual grouping field; leave blank to avoid phase grouping |
| `LEAVE_PASS_NB` (optional) | `MEMBER_LEAVE_MONITOR[LEAVE_PASS_NB]` |
| `Status` (or `status`) | `REF_STATUS_ID[Status]` |
| `DETAILS` / `NOTE` (optional) | `MEMBER_LEAVE_MONITOR[DETAILS]` / `MEMBER_LEAVE_MONITOR[NOTE]` |

### What this variant changes

- Renders **one row per member** (grouped by `MEM_UID` when available) and places multiple leave bars for that member on the same line.
- Drops hierarchy-derived `phase` grouping so rows are controlled directly by your external member slicers.
- `phase` is now optional; if omitted, no hierarchy path is built.
- Includes guards for invalid/missing dates to prevent Deneb SVG path errors when source rows are incomplete.
- Defaults leave bars to **100% completion** (for leave periods this behaves like a full block).
- Maps status colors to leave-friendly values: `Approved`, `Pending`, `Rejected`, `Cancelled`.
- Renames table headers to member/leave language (for example, `Member`, `Leave From`, `Leave To`, `Leave Status`).

If your status values differ, edit the `statusColumn` signal in the spec.
